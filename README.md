# TLExtractor

TLExtractor is a Python script designed to extract specific students datas from tldraw pages. It utilizes a template that students have to submit to for their projects, and must be followed in order to ensure data accuracy of this script. Extracted data is saved as JSON, while processed images (resizing) are stored in a folder named after the project title. 

This script accommodates two scenarios: the **standard tldraw** and **tldraw with a custom submission template**, each with unique but similar designs.

## üìÑ Custom Submission Template

For more information on the **custom submission template**, visit:

</br>

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîç Depth-first Search**:
  - Utilized for data searching and saving.

- **‚ö° Async**:
  - Creates multiple coroutine objects depending on the number of pages.  
  - Runs concurrently using Event Loop.
  - Uses Async Playwright to extract data.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Multi-Processing**:
  - Process multiple recursion functions. Retrieve student names that submitted their project.
  - Processes multiple images, especially useful when there are many images to process.
  - Multi-Processing (17) is nested inside Async as the start is more I/O intensive and the end is more CPU intensive.

- **üßµ Multi-Threading**:
  - Creates as many loading threads as there are coroutine objects.
  - Simulates loading screen.

## üìã Template Format

The script requires data in a specific format:

#### General
- Text including the page description and date should follow the format: `<description>::<date>`, nested in the main/outermost frame only.
- Only use 'frames' or 'groups' for grouping.
- The main/outermost frame name must match the page name exactly.
- Avoid special characters.

#### For Standard Tldraw Only
- **Student Submissions**: 
  - Images inside the main 'frame' are assumed to be student submissions. 
  - `Do not` carelessly put images inside otherwise.

- **Frame Titles**: 
  - The title of the 'frame' is assumed to be the student's name.
  - Only saved when it has an image encased inside.
  - Always ensure that the 'frame' encasing all of a student's submissions has the student's name as its title.

- **Nested Frames**: 
  - Do not have nested 'frames' of submissions that are already inside the student frame.
  - 'Grouping' them, however, is fine.
